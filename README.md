Various 3D models I've adapted or created for my own use


## [DeWalt Miter Saw (DW715) to RIGID 12G Shop Vac (HD1200) Hose Adapter](models/dw715_hd1200_hose_adapter)
This adapter provides a snug fit between my miter saw's dust port and my shop vac's 2.5" hose.

The DW715 dust port's outer diameter is ~1.5" (38.1mm). I wanted the adapter to fit inside and found the best size for a snug fit was 1 13/32" (35.8mm).

The male end of the HD1200 is a tapered 2.25" (57.15mm). 2 9/32 (58mm) was a perfect fit on the adapter.

I used [FollyMaker's work](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1246651) as a starting point.
